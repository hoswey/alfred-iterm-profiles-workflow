## üî® Development

When developing an Alfred workflow, you can call `alfred-link` directly from your cli. Use `npx` to call the local installation of `alfred-link` and `alfred-unlink`.

```
$ npx alfred-link
```

This will create a symlink in the Alfred workflows directory pointing to your development location without transforming `info.plist`.

To remove the symlink afterwards, you can call `alfred-unlink`.

```
$ npx alfred-unlink
```
